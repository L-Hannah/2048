#Remake of the web game 2048

The game 2048 remade with inspiration from websites such as [play2048](https://play2048.co) or [mobile app versions](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androbaby.game2048&hl=en&gl=US).

##Installation

A release has been placed in [releases](https://github.com/L-Hannah/2048/releases/tag/v1.0.0) but requires .NET runtime to be installed.
Alternatively, the source code can be cloned into visual studio and ran/edited from there, however .NET runtime would still need to be installed.
